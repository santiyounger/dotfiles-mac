Although my main set up is in Linux. I recently decided to give mac a try. I've had an old 2013 iMac which I'm trying to resurect. 

I've been pretty impressed at how many Linux stuff can be also set up in mac.

Feel free to explore this configurations, but keep in mind this are mostly for my personal use. There will be things that requiere further setup.

With that said, feel free to explore what you find useful.

Enjoy!
